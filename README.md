# Fedecan.ca

This is the repository for the [fedecan.ca](https://fedecan.ca) website. The site is built with VitePress and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Development

### **Setup & Start a local development server:**

[recommended extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) for VS Code

```bash
pnpm install    # install dependencies
pnpm docs:dev   # start a local development server
```

### **Deployment:**

Before making a PR, check for build issues locally. Some issues will not appear in the local development server, but will make the live build fail. 

```bash
pnpm docs:build     # build the site 
pnpm docs:preview   # preview the built site
```

If you don't see any errors, you can make a PR to the main branch.

- When linking to other pages, [don't use any file extensions](https://vitepress.dev/guide/routing#linking-between-pages).
- If you are getting a warning message on the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file, refresh it by following the [instructions here](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions/issues/215#issuecomment-1634719484).

### **Icons:**

We are using [iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design), search for icons [here](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/).

1. Filter results to find icons with a compatible license. For example, `Material Design Icons`
2. Copy the icon name, such as `ic:outline-email`, then use it as follows:

```html
<Icon icon="ic:outline-email" />
```
