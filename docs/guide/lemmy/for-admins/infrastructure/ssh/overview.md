# SSH

## What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that is used to securely connect to a remote server or device over an unsecured network. SSH provides a secure way to access and manage a server remotely by encrypting the data that is transmitted between the client and the server.


## What is OpenSSH?

OpenSSH is a free and open-source implementation of the SSH protocol. It is the most widely used SSH server and client software and is included in most linux distributions. OpenSSH provides a secure way to connect to a remote server and manage it remotely.

The official documentation for OpenSSH can be found [here](https://www.openssh.com/).
