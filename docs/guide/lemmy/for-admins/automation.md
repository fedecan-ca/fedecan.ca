# Lemmy Automation

## Tools or Libraries for automation of Lemmy


Lemmy has a API that can be used to automate tasks. Here are some tools or libraries that can be used to automate Lemmy.

## Lemmy API

The official Lemmy API documentation can be found [here](https://join-lemmy.org/api/). The API will change every time a new version of Lemmy is released.

There are some unofficial API documentations:

- [lemmy.readme.io](https://lemmy.readme.io/)
- [Lemmy OpenAPI Spec](https://mv-gh.github.io/lemmy_openapi_spec)

## Lemmy API Libraries

There are some libraries that can be used to interact with the Lemmy API. There is only one library that is officially supported by Lemmy:

- [lemmy-js-client](https://join-lemmy.org/api/)

(Note: This doubles as the official Lemmy API documentation and the official JS library documentation)

There are some unofficial libraries:

### Python

- [pythorhead](https://github.com/db0/pythorhead)
- [plemmy](https://github.com/Fedihosting-Foundation/plemmy)
- [lemmy.py](https://codeberg.org/retiolus/Lemmy.py)

### .NET

- [Lemmy.Net](https://github.com/ydinkov/Lemmy.Net) - A Dependency Injected HttpClient for the Lemmy API in dotnet
- [Lemmy.Net](https://github.com/Rickebo/Lemmy.Net) -  	A Lemmy API wrapper for .NET

And many more. If you have a library that you would like to add to this list, please open a pull request.

A almost complete list of libraries can be found [here](https://github.com/dbeley/awesome-lemmy?tab=readme-ov-file#libraries).
