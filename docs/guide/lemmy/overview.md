# Lemmy

Lemmy is a forum-style social media platform, often referred to as a 'link aggregator'. You may be familiar with websites such as Reddit or Hacker News, which are similar in nature. You can share and discuss links, text, and images, and decide on what content rises to the top by upvoting and downvoting.

Lemmy is part of the Fediverse, and so when you sign up on a Lemmy website (commonly referred to as a Lemmy 'instance'), you can access content from a wide variety of sources, including other 'instances' of Lemmy, Mbin, Piefed, and more. There are even teams working to make it compatible with other open-source community platforms such as Discourse.
