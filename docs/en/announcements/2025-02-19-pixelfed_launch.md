After [moving in to our new server](https://fedecan.ca/en/announcements/2025-01-18_update-finances-new-server) last month, our next large project is to set up some new Fediverse platforms. One of the most requested of those was Pixelfed.

As with any new instance, some issues are to be expected and while we've done some testing already, please bear with us as things get going. For any support related issues with **pixelfed.ca**, please post in the new [!pixelfed@lemmy.ca](https://lemmy.ca/c/pixelfed@lemmy.ca) community.

<br>

### **You can sign up at:** [pixelfed.ca](https://pixelfed.ca/)

## What is Pixelfed?

Pixelfed is a free and open-source alternative to image sharing platforms such as Instagram.

Some key features of Pixelfed:

- **Ad-free and privacy friendly:** The platform doesn't need to make money, and so there are no ads and no data is sent or sold to third parties.
- **Open source and decentralized:** You can follow users from other instances running pixelfed, mastodon, and more. For more information on this, see our [Fediverse](../guide/get-started.md) guide.
- **Chronological feed:** There are no confusing algorithms designed to keep you scrolling for hours, nor does it limit who can see your posts. You get control over your own feed, and you can grow your audience organically.

We highly recommend that you check out their [official website](https://pixelfed.org/) for more information on the features and benefits of Pixelfed. Our instance, pixelfed.ca, is a run by Canadians and hosted in Canada, but is otherwise open to everyone.

Welcome! üçÅ
