# Lemmy Alternative UIs

Lemmy has a few alternative UIs that can be used to access the Lemmy instance. These UIs are built by the community and provide a different look and feel to the default UI. Some of these UIs are already hosted on many instances of Lemmy, while others can be self-hosted for your own Lemmy instance.
