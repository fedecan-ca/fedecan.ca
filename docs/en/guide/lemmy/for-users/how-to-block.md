### Effects

When you block a user, you will no longer see their posts or comments. They will also not be able to send you private
messages. However, they will still be able to see and reply to your posts and comments. In some version of Lemmy, you may
also still receive notifications from them.

### Exceptions

You can still see posts from blocked users if you go to a post over a direct link to it.  
**Local** Admins can not be blocked.

## Blocking a community

To block a community, go to the community page and click on "Block community" on the right sidepanel of the page.

the community

### Effects

When you hide a post, you will no longer see that post. You can still see the comments on the post, but you will not be
able to see the post itself. You can also still see the post if you go to the community page or the user's profile page.

### Show / Hide hidden posts

To show hidden posts find the "Hidden post" you want to show and click on the three dots on the right side of the post.
For example over a direct link, in the community page, in your feed, or in the user's profile page.

When you want to find a hidden post in a community page or in your feed you need to enable the option to show hidden
posts.
