# How to find communities on Lemmy

There are two incredible benefits to Lemmy being on the Fediverse:

- You are not limited to just the communities on the website you signed up with. If someone made a community on another Fediverse website that you want to join, chances are that you already can! In cases where you can't, there are likely people currently working on making it possible.
- People want to avoid the issues with old social media platforms, and so the platforms are not trying to maximize engagement and keep you scrolling constantly.

However, this also means that you get to have a more active role in finding the communities you want to join. Here are some tips on how you can do that:

::: tip ‚ùì I found a community on a different instance, how do I join it?

Please see the guide section on [how to open something in your instance](./how-to-open-in-my-instance.md) for more information.

There are also other ways to do this, such as by simply searching for it in your home instance's search bar. However that guide should get you through the contents on this page.

## 1) Join a community to discover new communities üôå

You can subscribe to these places to learn about more communities over time. 

This is one of the easiest ways to learn about new places passively.

## 2) Lemmyverse.net Search Engine üîé

If you already know what you are looking for, you can search for it with [lemmyverse.net](https://lemmyverse.net/communities)

::: tip üè† Set your Home Instance First

If you are using **lemmyverse.net** for the first time, you should set your home instance by selecting the `home` icon in the top right. 

This will make it so that all the links will open on the instance that you have a Lemmy account with, so that you can subscribe right away without having to edit the links.

## 3) Look Through other Instances üåê

A great way to find lesser known communities is to look at the `/communities` page on an instance. Different instances may have different themes or focuses, and so you can find related communities that way. 

For example, since **lemmy.ca** is a Canadian instance, you will find a lot of Canadian communities at [lemmy.ca/communities](https://lemmy.ca/communities). 

To find instances related to a particular topic, you can use these websites:

- [pangora.social](https://pangora.social/join) for an organized list of instances
- [awesome-lemmy-instances](https://github.com/maltfield/awesome-lemmy-instances#all-lemmy-instances) list on GitHub.
