    excerpt="Lemmy follows a forum format, similar to platforms like Reddit or Hacker News. You can share and discuss links, text, and images, and upvote/downvote content to decide on what content rises to the top. Lemmy is a federated alternative to these platforms, and so it has all the benefits of being a part of the Fediverse."
